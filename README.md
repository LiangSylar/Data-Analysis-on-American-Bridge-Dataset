 # Data-Analysis-on-American-Bridge-Dataset

This is a data analysis project for an American Bridge Dataset with ~720k samples and ~140 columns. We first designed and implemented a database with 7 subtables based on our analysis needs. Then, we study the following three questions: 
1. Get the year for every state in the US when the largest number of bridges were built in that state.
2. Find out the main factors of bridgesâ€™ maintenance/improvement cost. 
3. The number of newly built bridges using different materials in all time.

For question 2, we studied the impacts of Average Daily Traffic, Length of a Structure, Material Type, and Structural Type on the bridge maintenance cost. Specifically, we use Gamma Coefficients to analyze correlations of 2 categorical variables. 

For question 3, we recognized 3 major trends in the number of new bridges of different materials. We managed to analyze these trends with support from both internal database and external sources.
